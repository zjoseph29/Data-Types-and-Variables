"""Python for Visual Effects.

Assignment #1 - Data Types and Variables

Answer the following questions.
"""

# 1.- Make a program that solves and shows the summation of 64 + 32.
print(64+32) 

# 2.- Do the same as question one, but this time use variables instead of
# numbers.
number1= 64
number2=32
print(f"{number1+number2}")

# 3.- Make a program that prints a sentence that includes at least three variables
# using the `f-string` or the `.format` method.


# 4.- Given a sentence, print a variable that stores a string that contains a text
# that reports how many characters the sentence has and what kind of data type it is.
# The sentence is: "This is my second Python program."

# 5.- Write a program that calculates the overscan values of a given resolution
# and prints the result as a string. It must use three (3) variables at least:
# Width, height and percentage.
#   1. Assign a value to each variable.
#   2. (Optional) Calculate the overscan values of the resolutions and assign
#      them to new variables.
#   3. Create a variable called "report" and assign it a string that uses all the
#      variables used.
#           For example: "The 10% overscan of the resolution 1920x1080 is 2112x1188."
#   3. Print the value of the variable "report."
